<p>Be it interactive classroom experience or vibrant campus life, Universities in the USA provide the best to their students. U.S. masters and bachelor degrees are not just globally recognized but have an excellent reputation. The educational institutions are well funded and invest profoundly in research areas. The staff at U.S. universities are understanding of international students&rsquo; needs and queries. International students in the USA flourish in a multicultural environment instilling an important trait of cultural sensitivity among them.</p>

<h3><strong>Credit system in the U.S.</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A common ground for both the public and the private universities in the credits systems.</li>
<li>Students earn credits for courses they take and these credits count towards the completion of a program. Typically, a student requires 3-5 credits per course for an undergraduate degree/Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree. For a masters course, it is 3-4 credits per course. Typically, around 120-130 credit hours are required to complete a bachelors degree and 30-64 for Masters in US.</li>
<li>The U.S. education system uses the GPA or the grade point average, which is a scale from 0.0 to 4.0 to grade students. For a semester, these are calculated based on marks obtained in each course and credits earned for that semester. 4.0 represents A grade and 0.0 is equivalent to F grade. Each program will have different minimum GPA requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
